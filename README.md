# Simple Calculator

This is a take home assignment found [here](https://equalexperts.github.io/ee-tech-interviews-uk/calculator-problem.html) (version number `5b8d0fd276b6d288905ed2f63a934e057e8feca2`) , it is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It is built using [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run

```
cd ./simple-calculator
npm run start
```

## Demo

Please see demo available at https://simple-calculator-fawn.vercel.app/

## Notes

I struggled with adding tests to this project, I have never used testing in Preact before and I found it difficult to add the needed libraries along with jest. (Please see [next](https://github.com/spaceghostu/simple-calculator/tree/next) branch where I continued past the 90 minutes to add tests)
